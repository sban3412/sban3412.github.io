# Ball simulation project

## Description
I completed this project as part of the MIT javascript course, and it demonstrates my progress as a programmer. 

## Installation
 In this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHlPM_trx2I I show you how to create the ball movement with javaScript. 

## Usage
The ball js code consists of variables, functions, conditional statements, and setInterval statements. When reverse is true or the ball falls, I used a conditional statement to reverse the direction of the ball.Â The project will be further developed by changing the original position, velocity, and reversal

## Support

## Roadmap
This section could include any future fixes or improvements you might be planning for your project.
